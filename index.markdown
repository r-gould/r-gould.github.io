I am a 4th year (Part III) mathematics student at the University of Cambridge interested in meaningfully understanding learning in neural networks, i.e. elucidating the connections between all levels of abstraction -- from low-level parameter dynamics, to mid-level representations and circuits, and high-level inductive biases -- towards an understanding of intelligent systems. I am also interested in mathematical frameworks for inference & learning based on approximate Bayesian methods -- such as variational inference (see [this post](https://r-gould.github.io/2024/09/23/variational-perception-action.html)) -- as well as neuro-inspired methods of credit assignment (e.g. predictive coding) & action selection, towards systems that can efficiently reason.
