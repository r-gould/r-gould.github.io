I am a 4th year (Part III) mathematics student at the University of Cambridge, interested in understanding learning in neural networks and elucidating the connections between all levels of abstraction -- from low-level parameter dynamics, to mid-level representations & circuits, and high-level model behaviour -- towards a deeper understanding of intelligent systems. I am also interested in mathematical frameworks for learning and decision-making based on approximate Bayesian methods -- such as variational inference (see [this post](https://r-gould.github.io/2024/09/23/variational-perception-action.html)) -- as well as neuro-inspired methods of action selection and credit assignment (such as predictive coding), in pursuit of efficient reasoning systems.
