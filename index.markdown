I am a 4th year (Part III) mathematics student at the University of Cambridge, with an interest in meaningfully understanding learning in neural networks, aiming to elucidate the connections between all levels of abstraction; from low-level parameter dynamics, to mid-level representations and circuits, and high-level inductive biases. I am also interested in mathematical frameworks for perception, action, and learning, based on approximate Bayesian methods such as variational inference, and neuro-inspired methods of representation & reinforcement learning.
