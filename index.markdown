I am a 4th year (Part III) mathematics student at the University of Cambridge, interested in developing an improved scientific understanding of neural networks and their behaviours, leveraging such understanding towards reliable and transparent machine intelligence. I am also interested in mathematical formalisms of intelligent behaviour, such as those based on variational inference (see [this post](https://r-gould.github.io/2024/09/23/variational-perception-action.html)), for inspiring improved methods of learning and credit assignment.
