I am a 4th year (Part III) mathematics student at the University of Cambridge, broadly interested in understanding intelligent systems and the principles underlying learning in artificial neural networks. I am also interested in mathematical formalisms of intelligent behaviour based on approximate Bayesian methods -- specifically, based on variational inference (see [this post](https://r-gould.github.io/2024/09/23/variational-perception-action.html)) -- as well as neuro-inspired methods of representation learning (such as predictive coding) and reward-based learning, in pursuit of systems capable of efficient learning and reasoning.
